## Projects
### Student Assistant Web Application
[Link](https://github.com/Shiva-Sankar-07/Student-Assistant-Web-Application)

The Student Assistant Web Application is a dynamic and user-friendly platform designed to enhance academic support and organizational efficiency for students at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Utilized **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**, that offered the application user a seamless experience that adapts to user needs. By leveraging user analytics and feedback, the platform continually evolves, integrating features such as personalized task recommendations and real-time notifications. These enhancements have resulted in a notable 25% increase in user retention and engagement. Initially deployed on a local XAMPP server for rapid prototyping and testing, the platform was later transitioned to AWS and Azure cloud environments to ensure scalability and reliability, particularly during peak usage periods. This project demonstrates a commitment to leveraging technology to improve the academic experience and operational efficiency within the educational institution.

### Heart Disease Prediction and Analysis
[Link](https://github.com/Shiva-Sankar-07/Heart-Disease-Prediction-and-Analysis)

Used **Rpart, rpart.plot, ROCR and tidyverse** packages form **R programming language**  for building classification and regression models using decision trees, data manipulation, data modifications and creating powerful visualizations. Divided the dataset such that 70% of data is used for training the models and 30% of data is used for testing the model predictions. Used five algorithms in our project to make predictions. They are **Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine.**
- In Logistic Regression model, we achieved an accuracy of 82%.
- In K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, we achieved an accuracy of 85%.
- In Decision Tree model, we achieved an accuracy of 79%.
- In Random Forest model, we achieved an accuracy of 86%.
- In support Vector Machine model, we achieved an accuracy of 77%
Out of all the models, Random Forest model achieved highest accuracy and Support Vector Machine model achieved least accuracy.

### Custom Database Manager
[Link](https://github.com/Shiva-Sankar-07/Custom_Database_Manager)

Programmed a DBMS in C++ that included a storage manager for efficient read/write operations, a buffer manager for optimal memory management, and a record manager for effective record navigation. Implemented a B+-tree index to provide efficient disk-based indexing, improving query response time by 30%, and enabling faster data retrieval. Conducted testing and debugging of the DBMS, resulting in a 99% error-free system and a more reliable database management solution.

### Traffic Flow Analysis in different weather conditions
[Link](https://github.com/Shiva-Sankar-07/ML_PROJECT_FALL22)

This project addresses the pressing issue of traffic congestion, a significant problem exacerbated by the high volume of vehicles, inadequate infrastructure, and uneven development. Utilizing the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Data Set, which includes detailed weather information and hourly traffic data along the Minneapolisâ€“St. Paul route, the project involved extensive data cleaning and preparation to ensure optimal predictive accuracy. Various **machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost**, were implemented and compared. The Gradient Boosting model emerged as the most effective, achieving a 97% accuracy rating and a root mean square error of 362.48. This model demonstrates significant potential for future traffic flow predictions, offering a robust solution to mitigate congestion and improve urban mobility.

### Information Retrieval Project
[Link](https://github.com/Shiva-Sankar-07/IR_Project)

Built a Scrapy-based crawler for content crawling by Python that uses the Scrapy framework. The script will have modules for initializing the crawler using a seed URL or domain, as well as parameters like Max Pages and Max Depth to restrict the crawl range. Developed Scikit-Learn-based indexer using Python that takes advantage of Scikit-Learn's language processing and indexing capabilities. Utilized TF-IDF score/weight form to determine term relevance inside documents as well as throughout the corpus. After mapping terms to documents and their TF-IDF scores, created an inverted index data structure. Furthermore, I included Cosine similarity computations in order to allow effective retrieval of documents according to query similarities. Used Flask to construct a RESTful API for the query processing processor. The processor will feature comprehensive validation and error-checking techniques to ensure that requests that come in are correct and complete. This involves verifying JSON structure, query parameters, and sanitizing entries to avoid injection attacks.
